# CTF Zone 
You'll learn JavaScript for hacking through practice. I try to create a CTF focused on JS skills, and then I will explain the fundamentals of JavaScript according to the CTF. This way, you will understand why you need to delve deeper.

This challenge tests your understanding of JavaScript execution context, lexical environment, Hoisting and scope. Analyze the code carefully to find the vulnerability.

You can use GPT for assistance, but be aware it may not solve the challenge for you. If you're unfamiliar with these concepts, study them first using the resources below, then return to the CTF.

## Key Concepts You Should Know:
- Execution context
- Lexical environment
- Scope and block
- JavaScript Variables
- Hoisting



## How to Run

Clone the code and run the below command in your terminal: 

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8000
```
